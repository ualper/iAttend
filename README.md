IATTEND is my Gebze Technical University Graduation project with subject "LOCAL AUTHENTICATION WITH FACE DETECTION"



# Person And Workplace Detection With Selfie

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for your project is that there are situations where individuals need to prove that they are in a predetermined location at a specific time, such as security guards in guard zones or students during roll call. Current methods of proving location and attendance can be unreliable, and there is a need for a more accurate and secure solution. Your goal is to develop a mobile app that allows users to take selfies and upload them to a server along with time and location information, and then use machine learning algorithms to compare these selfies with sample pictures taken at the predetermined location and time to determine whether the user is actually in the correct location.

## Project Objectives
1. Provide a reliable and accurate way for users to prove that they are in a predetermined location at a specific time.
2. Develop a user-friendly and intuitive mobile app that allows users to take selfies and upload them to a server with ease.
3. Implement machine learning algorithms to compare user selfies with sample pictures taken at the predetermined location and time to accurately determine the user's location.
4. Use location services to obtain real-time location information and ensure that users are in the correct location.
5. Use face detection and recognition technology to ensure that the user in the selfie is the actual user who is supposed to be in the predetermined location.
6. Implement secure authentication and access control mechanisms to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access the app and the data it contains.

## List of the Technologies
Here is a list of the technologies and libraries that I can use in my Flutter project and app:
1. **Flutter**: A mobile development framework for building cross-platform apps with a single codebase.
2. **Flutter Camera plugin**: A plugin that allows you to capture images and videos from the device camera.
3. **Google ML Kit**: A set of machine learning APIs that enable developers to build smart apps with powerful machine learning models.
4. **Firebase**: A platform for building mobile and web applications that provides tools for authentication, database management, cloud storage, and more.
5. **TensorFlow Lite**: A lightweight version of the popular machine learning framework TensorFlow that allows you to run machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices.
6. **Dart programming language**: A client-optimized language used for building Flutter apps that offers fast performance and productivity.
7. **Cloud Functions for Firebase**: A serverless compute platform for building and connecting Firebase services that allows you to run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features.
8. **Firebase Storage**: A cloud-based storage service that allows you to store and serve user-generated content, such as images and videos.
9. **Firebase Authentication**: A service that provides user authentication and authorization for your app using email/password, Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, and more.

Using these technologies and libraries will help me to build a robust and reliable app that can accurately detect a user's location and face, and compare it with sample pictures taken at predetermined locations and times. Additionally, Firebase provides a secure backend for storing and managing user data, while TensorFlow Lite enables me to run machine learning models directly on the mobile device for fast and efficient processing.

## Possible Success Criteria
1. **Face detection and recognition accuracy**: The app should be able to accurately detect and recognize the user's face in the uploaded selfie images with a high level of accuracy (e.g., at least 95% accuracy).
2. **Location services reliability**: The app should be able to reliably obtain and track the user's location in real-time, and accurately determine whether the user is in the predetermined location or not.
3. **Usability of the app**: The app should be easy to use and intuitive, with a user-friendly interface that allows users to take selfies and upload them to the server with ease.
4. **Machine learning algorithm accuracy**: The machine learning algorithms used in the app should be accurate and reliable, with a high level of precision in determining whether the user is in the predetermined location or not.
5. **App performance**: The app should be fast and responsive, with minimal lag or delays in taking and uploading selfies, and processing images.
6. **Security and privacy**: The app should be secure and protect user data, with secure authentication and access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access.
7. **Attendance records accuracy**: The attendance records generated by the app should be accurate and reliable, with a high level of precision in determining whether the user is present in the predetermined location or not.
